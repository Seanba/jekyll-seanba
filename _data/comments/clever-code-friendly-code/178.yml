  Shay, no doubt about it: in moments of weakness I'm certainly guilty of needing people around me to perceive me as smart. It's just ironic that such efforts are self-defeating.


  I like how code reviews help us keep it real. If I can get another programmer to review my work and s/he understands it with minimal guidance then I've won the day.
