message: Great article. I think almost every programmer (like the entire Perl community) could stand to be reminded that making yourself look or feel clever is of no value to a project or a team. The ability to do something clever when necessary is fantastic; actually doing something clever usually means. Of course, it might be a part of programmer psychology that we're driven by the desire to prove our cleverness - I know I'm guilty of that. I try to remind myself that my definition of "clever code" should really mean "code that does the job well and efficiently AND is readable by any other programmer." Being able to write code that is so readable that it doesn't need comments (which happens less rarely than some people would admit) is now my definition of cleverness!
