message: Good review of a great game. Have to point out something though. I'm pretty sure the platform he's standing on in the "punched instead" picture is just about to dissapear leaving you just enough time to mash buttons in a panic hoping you can somehow escape your fate. You can't. Brings make a lot of great memories either way though.
