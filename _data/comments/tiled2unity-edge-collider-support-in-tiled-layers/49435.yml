  I'm quite stumped here as to how I can access a property in  unity that I make in tiled, can you enlighten me in how to make a custom one?


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Wowsers, during import into Unity, any custom property that you have in your Tiled file will be passed on, automatically, to a 'Custom Importer' that you have to create. I talk about Custom Importers in this post here: <a href="http://www.seanba.com/megadadadventures.html">http://www.seanba.com/megadadadventures.html</a>.</em>
