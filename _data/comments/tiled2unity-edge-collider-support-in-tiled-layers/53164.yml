  Hi Seanba, thanks for your great work.


  Supposed I want to add Platform Effector to all the tiles in a layer (typical of endless runner one way platform), Can I use the custom properties in the layer, or I should put the custom properties in all the platform tiles? Would appreciate if you can also post a code snippets for that. Thanks!
