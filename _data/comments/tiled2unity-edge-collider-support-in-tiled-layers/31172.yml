message: Thank you for your efforts for making Tiled2Unity. I've got a slight issue with Tiled though. I'm unable to fit the collisions into the map. I open up the map in the Tiled editor. After that, I use the Tile Collision Editor and add the respective polygon colliders. I save the map and reimport the map into Tiled2Unity but it does not show the finely dotted lines which represent the colliders. Please do help me with this problem. Thank you for your time.
