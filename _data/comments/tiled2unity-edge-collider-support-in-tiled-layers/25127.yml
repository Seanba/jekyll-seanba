  Hi Sean, I tried this tool today and it worked wonderfully. Thanks so much for releasing this (especially for free) and thoroughly explaining how it works. I may be back with questions once I dive into animated tiles and object layers, but for now I just wanted to let you know I appreciate all the work you've done! I also checked out your Megaman/Cutman project and was really shocked to see that you managed to faithfully recreate not only the graphics but the physics too. Well done!


  <em>[<strong>Seanba says</strong>: Thanks, Jeff. The precursor to Tiled2Unity was the best part of tech to come from the Megaman in Unity exercise. I'm glad to see other people are finding it useful.]</em>
