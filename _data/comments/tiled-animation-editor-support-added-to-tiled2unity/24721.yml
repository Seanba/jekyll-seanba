message: Hi GreyToad, I get asked about procedurally generated content often. Tiled2Unity assumes you are using Tiled to create maps/levels/whatever. The only way I could see it working is if you build pieces of levels in Tiled, export into your project with Tiled2Unity, and then stitch those pieces together with some custom scripting.
