  You mentioned that animated tiles might be computationally expensive since each frame is its own mesh. Would it be better to simply instantiate a prefab animated tile into that area when you first load the scene?


  Additionally, are there any plans to allow "marker tiles" that can be replaced with prefabs when the room is instantiated?  For example, a coin marker would be replaced with a coin prefab that has its own set of components and whatnot.


  Just curious! Thanks again for your great tool.
