  Hi Sean, Thanks for creating such a useful tool and making it free :)


  I recently learned of Tiled2Unity from another forum, and am really interested in it for its animated tile capabilities. I'm considering switching from my current solution, but am curious if it can do what I need, which is to create levels during run-time. I am creating a rogue-like and will need to generate random levels. Your help would be greatly appreciated!
