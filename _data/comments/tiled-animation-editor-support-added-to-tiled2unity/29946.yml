message: seanba hello , I want to thank you for your contributions and helps you bring to the community. In fact , I work with tiled2unity it's been two days, but I can not have a good result so I come to you to help me. My card goes in the direction of Mario Bross , a horizontal card. I realized the card with tiled but when I import it into my szene it is too big that I do not ensorts me with the other element ( sprites ).
