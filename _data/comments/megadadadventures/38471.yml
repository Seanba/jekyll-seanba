  Just a heads up, the water and ladders examples seem to be broken in Unity 5.1.3. You might want to fix that.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Thanks, Candescence. Turns out the problem was missing tag settings which are not exported into the *.unitypackage file. I've instead zipped up the whole project (updated to latest Tiled2Unity and Tiled versions) that has everything you need -- you just won't be able to import it into your own Unity project with ease.</em>
