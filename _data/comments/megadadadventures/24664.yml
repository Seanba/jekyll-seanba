  Weird, I must be missing something- I started with a fresh project (2d), imported no additional packages, then imported super mega dad.


  All objects started out with "Default" layers.  Once I added a "Ladder" layer (because it didnt exist), I tried to reassign the objects' layers, to no avail.  I then wiped the imported super mega dad package re-imported, and it kinda works.  I can climb down a ladder once, then it acts like a solid wall again.


  I imagine there may be some more layers etc missing in my empty project.
