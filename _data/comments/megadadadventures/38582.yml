message: I was just wondering if it would be reasonable to do some sort of Fire Emblem like game using Tiled and this importer? The idea I had would to have the different tile be on separate layers? I do not know if Tiled2Unity would be the best solution for this. Would you mind giving your insight. Thanks!
