  I've got what might be a dumb question. I've been using Tiled2Unity for a 2D platformer, and it's been working out great, but I'm trying to implement some ground that collapses underneath the player when they stand on it. When I insert a tile into the object layer, though, that tile isn't rendered when I export. I've got a script that checks if the player has collided, and then the ground destroys, and I want to get that little bit of delay like in Super Metroid, as opposed the the player just immediately falling through the ground.


  What is the best way to accomplish this? I know I could just create a 1x1 prefab by hand and give it a sprite ripped from my tilesheet and attach it to the gameObject, but I'm wondering if there's a way to automate at least part of this to get the tile from the Tile Object in Tiled, or the collider shape that I've already specified.


  Thanks!
