  Hi, thx for these tutorials, just a question, does the "unity:tag" works on tile instead of layer in TME ? My "unity:layer -&gt; blockedlayer" work on a layer but my "unity:tag -&gt; rock" don't on my tiles... Am i supose to create a new layer for rock and asign the tag ever on a layer ? :x


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Flashbak, if you have just the one collision type ("rock") then you do not need a separate layer. Just put the collision shapes on the tiles you are supposed to collide with in the Tiled Collision Editor.


  If you require different collision types ("rock", "lava", "ladder", whatever) then you will want different layers for each type of collision. However, I use the Tiled Autompping feature so that I only drop tiles in my "master" layer by hand, then have the Automapper do the rest of the work on the separate layers.


  You cannot access properties on separate tiles as 2D maps grow with O(N^2) complexity. </em>
