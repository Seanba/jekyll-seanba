message: Hi Kevin, yes, tiles in the Object Layers are purposely not rendered. It sounds like what you need is a Tiled Layer with a given Tag. When you want that layer to go away you have a script somewhere that looks for GameObjects with that Tag and disables them. This should remove the rendering and colliders you no longer want to interact with. Does that make sense?
