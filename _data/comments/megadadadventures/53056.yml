message: 'Great tool, quick question: Is it possible to tag the Collision object generated by Tiled2Unity using custom properties? Currently, only the parent object receives the tag set by unity:tag, causing collisions to return Untagged. This can be fixed manually in Unity by assigning a tag to the Collision object after importing, but this is not ideal.'
