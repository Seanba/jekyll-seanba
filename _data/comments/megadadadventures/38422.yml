message: "Is it possible to use a tile layer, but not import it as a mesh? Basically I have a tile layer, and there's some tileset images that always spawn a prefab where ever they are on the map (think of a bush image), but I'd like to just set that tile property to spawn-prefab: xxxxx, and use the tile layer to place them, rather than painfully inserting tile objects into an object layer."
