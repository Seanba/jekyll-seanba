  Question regarding mapping certain tiles to specific sorting layers in Unity:


  You write the following: -------------- Important Update: With Tiled2Unity 1.0.5.0 and later you no longer need to use the unity:layer property. Instead, use the Type field of your rectangles, polygons, and polylines in the Tile Collision Editor. This Type will match the physics layer in your Unity project. --------------


  But what do I do if the tile in question doesn't have any collision object that got added through the Tile Collision Ediotr? E.g. a tree top which shouldn't have any collision because the player can walk behind it. In that case I lack the collision object where I could set the correct layer in the type field.


  Thanks a lot!
