  Hello,


  Apparently the fix for 4.x doesn't work for 4.7, because I had to add: || UNITY_4_7 to the lines: #if UNITY_4_0 || UNITY_4_0_1 || UNITY_4_1 || UNITY_4_2 || UNITY_4_3 || UNITY_4_4 || UNITY_4_5 || UNITY_4_6


  In order to get rid of the compile errors. So if anyone have the same issue with 4.7, this is the solution.


  Oh, and thank you for this tool, it's so awesome :)
