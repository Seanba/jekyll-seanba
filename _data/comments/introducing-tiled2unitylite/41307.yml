  Thanks to Seanba and all those who posted comments here for mading t2u available for Mac!


  I've finally managed to set up t2u, and the last question which I have is how is it possible to change vertex scale when you export your map?




  <em><strong>Seanba sez: </strong></em> <blockquote>Use the -s or --scale option. For instance, if you want to do 1/100 scale the command would be:


  <code>/bin/sh /MyPath/tiled2unitylite.sh %mapfile -s=0.01 /MyProject/Assets/Tiled2Unity</code> or <code>/bin/sh /MyPath/tiled2unitylite.sh %mapfile --scale=0.01 /MyProject/Assets/Tiled2Unity</code>


  Keep in mind the scale value needs to be 1/v and not v/100. A common mistake for someone that wants to use 1/32 scale is to use a scale value of 0.32 instead of 0.03125. </blockquote>
