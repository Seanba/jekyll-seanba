  Hi Sean,


  Just wanted to make sure I'm putting the two files contained in the 'Tiled2UnityLite.zip' into the right places:


  1. 'Tiled2Unity.unityproject' - sounds like this goes into the root of my Unity project 2. 'Tiled2UnityLite.cs' - does it matter where this is stored as long as 'mono $CSSCRIPT_DIR/cscs.exe Tiled2UnityLite.cs --help' is run once from within the parent directory?


  It looks like the 'tiled2unitylite.sh' file can be stored anywhere as long as the path is valid in the Execute Command GUI, but does this need to be in the same folder with 'Tiled2UnityLite.cs'?


  Thanks!
