  Hi. I'm struggling to get this to work on OSX Yosemite. I followed all the instructions above but when I try to "Execute In Terminal" in Tiled I get "Unable to create/open" with paths to my folders. I checked all the paths and they should all be valid. I'm not really used to working in Terminal so I might have missed setting a correct path or rights to a file somewhere.


  Any  ideas?


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Mikael. Turns out this was an issue with Tiled depending on what the current working directory would be when you executed the command. Good news, though. I notified Bjorn (author of Tiled) and he has fixed it. You'll need one of the daily builds until he puts out his next official release.
