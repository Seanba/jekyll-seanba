  When I download cs-script, it downloads a "cs-script.7z" and not a folder. I was wondering why this is and what to do about it. Thanks.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> 7z files are compressed archives, not unlike zip files. You will need a utility to extract the contents into a folder. I use Unarchiver for that.</em>
