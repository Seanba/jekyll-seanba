  Hi, quick update, I realised that I needed to append the filename and location of the .tmx file that I have saved out of 'Tiled' to the end of Efe's Terminal command, and that i also need to specify the 'UNITYDIR' (the location to save the converted file out to) - I have now done this and I think it's worked.


  Just to clarify, the whole command I entered into terminal was as follows:


  /usr/local/bin/mono $CSSCRIPT_DIR/cscs.exe -nl Tiled2UnityLite.cs $* &amp;&gt; tiled2unitylite.log /Users/jidrees/Youtube_RPG_Tutorial/Assets/tutorial_map_01.tmx /Users/jidrees/Youtube_RPG_Tutorial/Assets/Tiled2Unity/
