message: Hello, i am having the same problem as johnrm, i know nothing about programming but i managed myself to get to the step where i run the help command to start using tiled2unitylite, so i should be ready to export maps but nothing happens, i run the shell script from Tiled, but nothing happens, i think im missing like 2 or 3 thing, like making the tiled2unitylite.sh file correctly, could you tell me how to make the .sh file correctly and if there is another problem or thing that i am missing? thanks for the tutorial :)
