  .bash on elCapitain


  Step 1: Open up a Terminal window (this is in your Applications/Utilites folder by default)


  Step 2: Enter the follow commands:


  touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile


  This will open the .bash_profile file in Text Edit (the default text editor included on your system). The file allows you to customize the environment your user runs in.


  Step 3: Add the following line to the end of the file adding whatever additional directory you want in your path:


  export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"


  That example would add ~/.rbenv to the PATH. The $PATH part is important as it appends the existing PATH to preserve it in the new value.


  Step 4: Save the .bash_profile file and Quit (Command + Q) Text Edit.


  Step 5: Force the .bash_profile to execute. This loads the values immediately without having to reboot. In your Terminal window, run the following command.


  source ~/.bash_profile


  Thatâ€™s it! Now you know how to edit the PATH on your Mac OS X computer system. You can confirm the new path by opening a new Terminal windows and running:


  echo $PATH




  my new entry in .bash profile now looks like this


  export CSSCRIPT_DIR=/Users/Ricard/CS-Script export PATH=$PATH:$CSSCRIPT_DIR export css_nuget=/Users/Ricard/CS-Script/nuget


  and I can run (from the right dir)


  mono $CSSCRIPT_DIR/cscs.exe Tiled2UnityLite.cs --help
