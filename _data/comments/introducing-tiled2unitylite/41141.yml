message: "Sorry to post one comment so soon after another, but after rereading the tutorial, I was wondering if I had to make the tiled2unity.sh file, or if that was built into something somewhere along the tutorial(that I may have missed).\n\nSorry if I have been any sort of inconvenience.\n\n<em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Ryan, yes, you will need to create that tiled2unity.sh file yourself and you'll probably want it in the same folder that you unzipped Tiled2UnityLite.cs to. Managing your computer's $PATH and other environment variables is just one of those things that programmers eventually get used to. A necessary evil to be sure. </em> "
