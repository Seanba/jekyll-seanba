  Hi seanba,


  thanks for sharing, I have a trouble here. whenever i tried to execute the cscs.exe within the terminal i got this error :


  Cannot open assembly '/Users/xxxxxx/cscs.exe': File does not contain a valid CIL image.


  xxxx is the path to a custom folder where CS-Script is located. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


  Thanks!
