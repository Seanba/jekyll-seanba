  For those who had issue on "tiled2unitylite.sh: line 7: mono: command not found"


  Specifying mono(you can find by typing this command in terminal: which mono ) in tiled2unitylite.sh has worked for me like this: /usr/local/bin/mono $CSSCRIPT_DIR/cscs.exe -nl Tiled2UnityLite.cs $* &amp;&gt; tiled2unitylite.log
