  I've mostly gotten this working â€“ but the Unity import hooks aren't triggering, so I get the file in Assets/Tiled2Unity/Imported but none of the rest. Any idea? The Tiled2Unity files in the project were put in by the Windows non-lite version of Tiled2Unity, but replacing some of them by importing the package that came with the Lite version didn't help. I'm running Ubuntu Xenial, if it matters.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi there. Getting a *.tiled2unity.xml file imported into the Assets/Tiled2Unity/Imported folder should be the most complicated part. After that the Unity scripts will take it the rest of the way. Do you have any errors or warnings in your Unity console window?</em>
