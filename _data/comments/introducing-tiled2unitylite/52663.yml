  When I try to run this on linux, I get the error that there is no "Tiled2Unity" folder in my assets directory for my project.


  If I try to take a Tiled2Unity folder from another version, the prefabs are in there, but there is no mesh renderer, they are basically just empty prefabs rather than maps.
