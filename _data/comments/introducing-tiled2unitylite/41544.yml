  Hey great tutorial, Im just a little stuck at the part where you "Go to the directory youâ€™ve unzipped Tiled2UnityLite.cs to and run the help command on our script." I opened Titled2UnityLite.cs with Mono which like you said had 10,000 lines of script on it. I am confused as to where you enter the help command. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Jason, I'll try to edit the post to clarify but you want to run this command from the terminal:


  <code>mono $CSSCRIPT_DIR/cscs.exe Tiled2UnityLite.cs --help</code>


  Depending on how you have CS-Script "installed" you may need to replace $CSSCRIPT_DIR with the full path to your cs-script folder.</em>
