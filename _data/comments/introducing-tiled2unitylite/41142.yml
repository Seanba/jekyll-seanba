  I know I'm annoying now (1/3 of the comments are mine), and I am sorry, so last comment, I promise. I (again) reread the tutorial, and figured it pretty much all out(so you can disregard both of my other comments), and it is actually quite clear. Th only problem I'm having is when I run Export in tiled, I get no output. tiled2unity.log reveals the simple truth:


  "/Users/ryan/tiled2unity.sh: line 7: mono: command not found"


  I know I've said this, but I'm new to all this. Before when I needed to use the mono command, I called


  "export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/:${PATH}"


  Which allowed mono to run, but when inserted into tiled2unity.sh, the log has the same error message. Any help would be appreciated, and you can disregard all previous comments by me.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Ryan, I'm not too concerned about the comments. They can often help other people. You may want to email though as it will be faster to throw stuff back and forth. I would have emailed this to you if you had of put your address in the form when commenting ;)</em>
