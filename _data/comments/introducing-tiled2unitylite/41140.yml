  I am pretty new to all this, an I was looking for help with the final command in tiled, because I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. By this I mean- what do I actually need to write for the command in Tiled (I've figured how to make one at least), and where can I find these paths (if I need any).


  Sorry if I missed something obvious in the tutorial, but any clarity would be much appreciated.
