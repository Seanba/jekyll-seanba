  Hey Seanba.


  I really looking forward to the "press F5 to automatically export TMX files to Unity". I will probably try implement this feature today. But if you already start it, I may wait.


  Thanks for you remarkable work, by the way. Good day


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Red, my instructions above are for pressing F5 to do an automatic export. Are you having problems with it?</em>
