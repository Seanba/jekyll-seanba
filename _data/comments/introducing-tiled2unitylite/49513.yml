  HI\i, so i've been following this tutorial , and haven't had any luck after the point where you have to put in the commands. I'm getting confused as to what is supposed to go in the folder i unzipped the T2U, the CS folder, and how the commands go about finding each files necessary.


  This is what i put in the Tiled command maker, where i directly made links to my files


  /bin/sh /Users/CompName/tiled2unitylite.sh %mapfile /Users/CompName/Virtual\ Art/Unity/Tut_platV0.2/Assets/Tiled2Unity.


  I've tried running it and it seems to do nothing, nor do i notice anything in unity or in the logs. i'm really confused here.
