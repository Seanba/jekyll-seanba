  Hi, i made the whole process of the instructions until the last step.


  I edited my commands in Tiled, and replaced on the command mypath and myproject name in unity.


  However, when i use F5 or run the command in the terminal, it says command not found on all lines.


  Can you help me? Im really interested in using the program in mac since im stuck with a project if not.


  thank you in advance
