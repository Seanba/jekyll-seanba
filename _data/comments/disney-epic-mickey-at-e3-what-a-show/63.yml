message: Sean, The buzz surrounding Epic Mickey has been great and even the old PC gaming trolls on the forums I frequent are dusting off their neglected Wiis in anticipation of this game-myself included. I'm glad you're finally enjoying some positive hype as you've been attached to a few games in the past with "colourful" development issues and the hype leading up to their release became quite negative. I guess it helps when your studio head is actually interested in the gaming genre and pushing boundaries...unlike certain wannabe film directors and astronauts you've worked for in the past. I predict that Epic Mickey will have epic sales. Great IP, great development and creative talent and targeting a platform with a huge install base, but ravenous for exclusive titles. I smell royalty cheques!
