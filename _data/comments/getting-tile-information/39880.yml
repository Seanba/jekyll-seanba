  I had the same issue with the sample files, but once i upgraded my unity it went away.


  It might be that I am home with the flu but for the life of me I can't figure out how to spawn a custom object, like say a treasure chest from tiled and then have it work within unity. I was trying to add another


  "if (customProperties.ContainsKey("Terrain"))" but looking for another property like "Test" just after the other if statement but I cannot get it to work, but it is getting my updated map because i can see the geography change...


  I also can't seem to get any debug.log to output anything within the public class CustomImporter_StrategyTiles. To help with my debugging.. any suggestions?
