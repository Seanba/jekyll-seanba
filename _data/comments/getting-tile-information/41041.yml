  Hello, i got some questions concerning the polygoncollider2d approach. How do i know what kind of tile my raycast hit, is it the name of the layer or something? Basically i have a collider on each and every object, right? Doesnt that mean that i have to select which collider one can walk through and which not for every group of objects in unity for every map,which is a lot of work?


  Thanks for answering my questions in advance.


  Best wishes
