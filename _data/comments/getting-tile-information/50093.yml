  Hi there,


  Does anyone know about a good video tutorial on how to do this?


  I'm new to Tiled and Tiled2Unity, and can't find too much information on how this is done, I tried following the tutorial on this page but can't figure out how things are related to each other. For instance what is the TSX file in the repository? why are the custom properties grayed out in the sample maps? Do I need to write the custom script? where do I need to put it?


  Any help/comment is appreciated.
