message: I have both Unity 4.6.7  and 5.1.1 and none of them seems to be able of open the project ...at least i tried to open the scene on 4.6.7 (Yesterday) and i got some critical errors about materials, textures and other kind of stuff ... sadly i didn't take a pic ... sorry. Which version is the one that you used on how did you open it?
