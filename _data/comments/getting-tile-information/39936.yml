  ty for answer. It is not works on object layer :c my main problem is the animated tiles had poor performance.  i made a customTiledImport for handle animations. It is works well, but after every BIG ASS EXPORT i have to delete 2d box collider.  I have not found the instantiation script and i couldnt destroy the boxcollider in the customtiledimport script. sry for my terrible english and thx any advice.
