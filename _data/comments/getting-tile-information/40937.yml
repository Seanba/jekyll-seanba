  Thanks for your tutorial but I am having some issues. In my case, in StrategyTile class I'm storing all tile attributes into a public member Dictionary TileProperties, I modified properly CustomTiledImporter to add each custom property to TileProperties dictionary and print a log message. Log message is printed but then in the inspector the dictionary appears empty and i don't know why.


  I'm a bit newbie with Unity but I am a medium skilled programmer in Java and I know C# aswell.


  Merry Christmas.
