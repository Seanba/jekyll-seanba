  Would you consider updating this post with an alternative (an Option #2 approach)


  You can rig Unity to automatically set the "Pixels Per Unit" to 1 by extending the "AssetPostprocessor" class in the UnityEditor namespace.


  ex: /** MyTexturePostProcessor.cs **/ using UnityEditor;


  public class MyTexturePostProcessor : AssetPostprocessor { void OnPreprocessTexture () { TextureImporter textureImporter = (TextureImporter)assetImporter; textureImporter.spritePixelsPerUnit = 1; } }


  You can read about the AssetPostprocessor here: http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.html


  Don't need to add it to any scene.  It just works.  Any new image assets added should automatically update to reflect 1 pixel per point.  This should also make it easier to work with coordinates.


  I can't take credit for this suggestion because I didn't take time to read all the comments here (TL;DR) someone might've already suggested it, plus I figured this out from googling.
