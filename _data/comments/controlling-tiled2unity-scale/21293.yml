  Hello, Thor. There's a couple of things you can do:


  1) Change this line in the Tiled2Unity scripts to the filter mode you want: textureImporter.filterMode = FilterMode.Point;


  2) Use textures that are already part of your Unity project. In this case, Tiled2Unity does not try to overwrite the texture settings.


  I'll think of way I can make this process better. Maybe I can have a property on the tileset (in Tiled) that gives direction to the Tiled2Unity importer scripts.
