  Hello kong, it's common for people doing 2D game development in Unity to have seams appear and I apologize for not having a 100% solid solution yet for that. (I get around the issue by controlling my camera position in-game)


  Also, I just tried the same example file with that scale and it looks okay for me. Granted, different graphics cards will highlight the problem stronger than others.


  How does the scene look in "Game View"? If looks that bad there I don't mind taking a look at your example. Just email me your project as a Unity Package and I'll see what I can find. Thanks.
