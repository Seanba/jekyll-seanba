  Hey Sean!


  If you have some time I'd like to ask why everything I export from Tiled is extremely blurry? I've looked in the comments above for suggestions but I seem to be missing the mark here.


  Here is an Imgur album showing what I mean: http://imgur.com/a/E62cw


  Do you have any suggestions on how to fix this?


  I went looking for the line of code "textureImporter.filterMode = FilterMode.Point;" however it's already set to Point filter mode, so nothing I can change there.


  Any help would be great, thanks!
