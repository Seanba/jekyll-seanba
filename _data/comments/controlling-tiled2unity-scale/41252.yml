  I agree with @thor6136 -- I'd also be interested in seeing a property exposed for each image used for the filter mode used for the generated Unity texture.  I tend to prefer using bilinear in my game -- it seems to blur less when the scene scrolls.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Datahead, you can change the properties on the Texture Importer to fit your tastes per texture. They will not be undone by Tiled2Unity when you export again.</em>
