  Hello Seanba! Please help. My problem is similar to the rest here(some lines between tiles), I've turned off Pixel Snap but I don't know how to change the texture filter mode from the prefabs. Ive turned off anti aliasing but the lines are still there.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Depending on the size of the textures used in your tilesets, the easiest way to remove seams is to tuck-in the texture coordinates by launching Tiled2Unity with the --texel-bias setting set to some power-of-two value. By default, this value is 8192 (so that texture coordinates are tucked in by 1/8192th of a pixel). Try a smaller number (4096, 2048, etc) until seams disappear. Don't choose a number that is equal to or smaller than your largest texture width or height though.


  BUT ... the best way to fight seams is to surround your tiles in your tileset with matching pixels so that when Unity's texture sampling miscalculates a texel (that's what is causing your seams) it chooses a texel with the same color. You can read more about that here: http://www.firebelly.net/post/114529965784/tile-gaps-using-unity-5-and-tiled2unity</em>
