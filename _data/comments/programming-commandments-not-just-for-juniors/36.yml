  Hey Sean!


  I like the article! (I wonder why.) I got a lot of healthy debate on that post, and I'm really glad! Guess it goes to show that it should be labeled a rough draft now! There are definitely a lot of gotchas and tidbits that I took for granted when originally writing it. Commandment for every programmer: Assume no one else knows!


  On number eight, I guess I kind of assume that everyone is working with source control! :p  But really, I guess I should have advised caution. No one wants to be the guy who confused a need for a singleton for needing only a single instance. Also, if it takes too much time, it's obviously too risky.  Good call.


  I completely agree with you on writing better code before commenting as a crutch. I probably should have mentioned directly that commenting should not be about how and should only mention the why.


  "If only it wasnâ€™t written for just the junior programmer audience." Perhaps there is a better set for senior level programmers that includes mentoring and a few other points. I don't know. Just saying. Perhaps I have an unfinished draft somewhere.


  Thanks for the mention!
