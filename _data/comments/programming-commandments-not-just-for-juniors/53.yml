  From a producer's point of view I like #8 to a certain degree.  This is the good part of  "Just Do It".   After two hours of listening to two engineers snipe back and forth I went out and asked them how long it would take to implement each version.  One answer was 15 minutes and the other was 30 minutes.  (Kid you not)  I ordered both of them to implement, we (as a team) would evaluate the outcome and then choose.  Yes, they wasted 1.5 hours arguing semantics, and it was caused by #7, because the lead programmer didn't want to admit he was wrong!


  On the other hand I've had an engineer stay up all night to replace the animation system that would require all of the animations to be re-tweaked *by hand*.  He was instructed to undo that - on no sleep.
