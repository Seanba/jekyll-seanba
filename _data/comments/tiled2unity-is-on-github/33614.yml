  Updated it here with the newest version: Seems to work fine now. I had to scale the collision layers x2 for some reason though.


  To use: 1. Go to https://github.com/timminkov/Tiled2Unity 2. Download the Zip or clone the repo. 3. Use the exe in Tiled2Unity/tool/Tiled2Unity/src/bin/Debug/ as per instructions above (I use Mono, Wine didn't work for me).
