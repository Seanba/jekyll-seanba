message: '@Jgar I downloaded the zip from your link and was successfully able to open the windows file using wine (the reason I used yours was because the one the developer made crashed when I used wine). Once I opened it and followed the step by steps and I was about to press the button "open" for my tile file the thing would crash. What should I do?'
