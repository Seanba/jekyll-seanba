message: I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to get tiled2unity to work for mac. I tried following the posts on here, but some steps are over my head. I am also not sure how to navigate files using the Terminal. I drag and dropped the .exe in terminal and it showed the path. I hit "return" to run it, but I received an error.
