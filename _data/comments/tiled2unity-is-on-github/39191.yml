  For those who cannot use "mono" command in Terminal, this could be a reference: http://stackoverflow.com/a/32900575/1856717


  Or you can try open "Tiled2Unity.unitypackage" to import directly, which can be found in "Tiled2Unity-master/tool/Tiled2Unity/src/bin/Debug" (downloaded from https://github.com/Gnumaru/Tiled2Unity)
