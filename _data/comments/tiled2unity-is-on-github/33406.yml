  I'm following the instructions above, but when I try to import the package into my project by help-&gt;Import unity package to project nothing is happening.  I tried importing the package from the Unity GUI, but could not find "Tiled2Unity.unitypackage".  Any advice?  Running OS X 10.10.3.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez</strong>: Hi GX, I haven't tried importing on Mac but the Tiled2Unity.unitypackage file is included in the zip file on the download page.</em>
