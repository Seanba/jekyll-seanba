  Hola Mac users! I tried the above tips but am getting an error: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'PresentationCore, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies.


  Quick searching revealed that this error would be related to a .NET version (at least if you get this error in Windows). Did you install anything else before installing tiled2unity via mono? I'm on OSX X Yosemite 10.10.3. Would be great to get this working :)
