  Hey there Sean!


  Hope you're doing  great, here i have a (silly) question, working with the object layers and types i had no problem exporting to unity, but how do i actually access the custom properties from the unity editor? ( i think it would be great if they appear at the gameobject properties at the inspector) Unity is recognizing my object types as layers but it doesn't show me the custom properties y created on Tiled.  Am i doing something wrong? (It would also be grate to be able to connect custom properties like Tag, to the inspector property on unity called Tag).


  Again thanks for your time and energy â˜¼


  Bless!, Afmo
