  Hey Sean, I love your Tiled2Unity utility (from what I've seen in YouTube tutorials and your blog posts) - thanks so much for your hard work. I've just started using it with Unity 5.5.0f3 and have noticed quite a few deprecation warnings. After automatically upgrading, I'm still left with some warnings - which another user has already opened a github issue for: https://github.com/Seanba/Tiled2Unity/issues/71


  Just wanted to drop you a line and see if you are aware. Thanks again for your utility, I will make sure to support via donation once I have the opportunity to use it!
