  Thought I'd drop my two cents in because this was bugging you.  Over the years I've been researching the brain's functions and here are some facts that might help you out.


  The act of thinking makes us tired - literally.  We use about 5X the amount of sugar when we think (say, program) than if we were to simply watch TV.  This causes all sorts of havoc with your brain processes afterward - including things like judgment and sociability.  So you shouldn't program and then make life-altering decisions because you'll go with whatever is 'easiest'.  And you also should have a meal and some rest prior to meeting up with family/friends.  Going out *after* dinner is better than going out *for* dinner.


  Plus, switching from a full day of working the Left Brain your poor Right Brain isn't really ready to kick in the social stuff.  The Right hasn't finished processing the emotions of the day (that's what the Right Brain does).  The overworked Right Brain will kick out 'grouchy', so he can wrap up the day's processing.  (There are more technical neurochemicals involved, but you get the point)  Being an adult you decide that being quiet or withdrawn is a better way to go than snappy and rude.


  People who are 'introverted' are better at using their Left Brain than their Right Brain, hence programmers tend to be less social than everyone else.  Despite being more social and talkative than most other programmers I've met - you still aren't what I could call a true extrovert, just not a full-time introvert.  :D  Extroverts, for example ,LOVE to walk into a place where they know no one and make friends with everyone.


  For what it's worth I never thought you were pretentious.  :)
