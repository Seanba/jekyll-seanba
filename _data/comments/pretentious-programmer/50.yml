  Thanks, Jen. BTW, have you read Pragmatic Thinkings and Learning? I finished it recently and thought it was a great read on left brain / right brain kind of stuff (or how the author writes it, linear mode / rich mode). Judging from your comment it seems you might like it.


  I agree, I wouldn't label myself a true extrovert by any means - but at least I'm not as bad as most programmer type guys. ;)
