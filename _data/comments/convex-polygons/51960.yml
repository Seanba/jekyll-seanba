  Hi Sean!


  I encountered a bug in the convex colliders. I have a long floor (21 tiles) with a step on both ends. However Tiled2Unity calculated the collider on that floor incorrectly, as seen here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1NTd6uEwN5DSG9JT0JDajBBU00 The tiles are 12x12 px and the floor tiles are entirely colliders.


  Thank you for your work! :)


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Thanks to Nanofus I was able to find a fix for an annoying edge-case in generating convex collider geometry.</em>
