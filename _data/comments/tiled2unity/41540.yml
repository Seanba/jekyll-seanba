  Hi!


  I Cant use it in mobile games?


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> You should be able to run on mobile devices just fine. However, I'm not a mobile developer and as such don't have the iOS or Android modules installed. I do know that other developers have been able to run Tiled2Unity on those devices though.</em>
