  Great article, have you seen uTiled?  It's a Unity asset for importing Tiled maps directly in to Unity as an importer.


  The above process looks great but does mean using a third party tool in between Tiled and Unity, which slows down the processing.


  Also are there any issues with the converted Tiled maps with some of the layering features in Tiled.


  Keep up the great work!.
