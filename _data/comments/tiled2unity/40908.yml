  Hi Sean,


  I'm getting a script error on import  (Import Unity Package to Project) in TiledAssetPostProcessor; using v 1.0.0.2 and 5.2.3f1, this prevents any prefab from being created


  <em><strong>Seanba sez: </strong>This is fixed now. The problem was Unity 5.0-5.2 didn't support a function I was using.</em>
