  Hello, if i export to mobile 2 layers will be invisible, how i can fix it?


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Leandro, I would expect all layers to be visible on mobile devices although I have to admit I haven't tested it (but others have used it fine). If this buggy behavior could be replicated on one of the other build targets that comes stock with Unity then I'm sure I could figure out what is going on.</em>
