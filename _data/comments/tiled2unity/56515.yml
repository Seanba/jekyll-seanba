  Hi,


  I'm up to this step here, after installing the unity plugin: "3. Export a TMX File Run the Tiled2Unity Utility and open a Tiled TMX file. Select a Unity project to export to and hit the "Big Ass Export Button".


  However, it won't let me open tmx files.  It only allows me to open xml files, and Tiled does not export to xml to my knowledge (I'm using 1.0.3).  Is this a bug or do I have the wrong version of T2U?
