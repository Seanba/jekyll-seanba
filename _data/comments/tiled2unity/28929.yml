  Hi thanks for amazing work. These days I was looking for tilemap plugins, and finally reached the conclusion that this one and 2dtoolkit are the best.


  But some feature, which cropping tile's transparent area and then gather into a altas again but in more minimal form, is missing. Actually this feature is really important for the performance and also binary size.


  So do you have any plan to support this cropping feature?
