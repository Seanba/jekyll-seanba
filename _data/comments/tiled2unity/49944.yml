  Hi Seanba,


  Beginner here. I'm trying to port my libgdx game into Unity. A big part of my game is derived from Tiled layer objects, animations, and a special collision layer I use. I understand you implement something called colliders but I dont want to use those as most of my game logic is setup to use the special collision layer. I need a way to access  a layers cell and their objects to implement my own system. Is there a way to do this, code samples I can reference?
