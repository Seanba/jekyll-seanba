  i have a question ...... is it only possible to import the maps to unity only or can you import them to other game makers such as rpg maker??


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi there. No, Tiled2Unity is specific to Unity projects. I would imagine RPG Maker has it's own method for creating maps/levels.</em>
