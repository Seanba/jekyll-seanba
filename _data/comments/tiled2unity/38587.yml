message: 'PS: I actually tried rescalling the tilemap manually and the closest exact scale factor I could get it to that should be its proper size was roughly 0.9765624. Which means the original scale of the tiles was off by roughly 0.0234376. Tiny, but again, a huge deal, as it adds up very quickly.'
