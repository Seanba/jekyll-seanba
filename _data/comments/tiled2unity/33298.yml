  This doesn't work for mac and i really want to be able to use it. That link you forwarded to Shayan has a lot of good links but all don't work for me. i use Wine to open your Tile2Unity.exe, but it always crashes and even some of the links I got from the That link you forwarded to Shayan crashed right before I was able to export my tile file to unity.
