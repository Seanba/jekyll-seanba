message: I really want to use the tiled2unity to use Tiled for unity maps but for some reason, after all the instructions I have followed, I clicked on the Big Ass Export Button but it only exports the XML file. I've seen your answer on a different thread where you mentioned that the XML file will unfold everything into the folders but in my Prefab folder, nothing was there X( Thankyou so much for all the work you have put into Tiled and tiled2unity and putting it up for use for free though!
