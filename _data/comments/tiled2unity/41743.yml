  I just tried to download T2U, but Chrome claimed a virus was detected. I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium, and whatever the latest version of MSE is. False positive?


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Yes, false positive. It happens every time I update Tiled2Unity. When I get some time I'm going to look into using a different installer. You can always you the zip in the meantime if you're worried about it.</em>
