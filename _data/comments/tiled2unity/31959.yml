  Hello Seanba, thanks for the great tool! I've came across a problem exporting my map that I can't seem to resolve. The first time I exported a map it worked perfectly but my collision wasn't quite right so I re-made the collision and exported the 2nd map but that one wasn't quite right either so I made a third one. Now when I try to export to Unity it just freezes and my project wont open. I can open my project by moving or deleting the Tiled2Unity folder but if I try to re-import and in Tiled2Unity and then Export to Unity it freezes. Have you come across this or having suggestions for fixing this issue?


  Also, I've also tried using a brand new project to export to and it still locks up on me.
