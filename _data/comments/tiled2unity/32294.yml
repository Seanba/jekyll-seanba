message: Also, it seems like the Pixels Per Unit setting in sprites are not affecting the imported map size, it's just using the default 100. Unfortunately 100 is too much, am I doing something wrong? The sprites are already in the Unity project so T2U is using them, it just seems to ignore the PPU setting.
