  Seanba, could something similar to what is in 0.9.13.0 (ignore: collision, etc), but to allow unique tiles to be generated if they contain special map tile properties be added in a future version?(not even generated, but handled by a custom importer would be good enough)


  Basically a pass-through to allow a custom-importer in Unity to process all tiles in a specified layer, by itself.
