  Oh, and one more easy one, your gizmo drawing should take the prefab scale into account.  TiledMap.cs should be more like:


  float GetMapWidthInPixels() { return this.NumTilesWide * this.TileWidth * transform.localScale.x; } float GetMapHeightInPixels() { return this.NumTilesHigh * this.TileHeight * transform.localScale.y; }


  That's still completely correct as the prefab could be getting scaled further by a parent, but it's closer, and probably handles the majority of cases (i.e. people using unity:scale).
