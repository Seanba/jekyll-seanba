  Hey Sean,


  First I would like to thank you for sharing this great tool. I have an idea and would like to know what you think: I'm an OSX user and would like to have access to the tool. I've seen that it supports a command line interface and thought that maybe it is possible to create a web app (hosted on a Windows server) that inputs a TMX file created in Tiled, converts it and expose a downloadable version of the converted blob (probably zipped) file to the user.


  If you think that is possible via the already existent command line interface, I can very much build this web app and host it somewhere for some tests. What do you think?


  Thanks!
