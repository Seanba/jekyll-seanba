  Hi Sean, this tool is AMAZING.


  I have a question about the new Object support.  I was redoing your MegaDad Water scene as all one layer (mostly for fun) using some of the newer Tiled features and I can't figure out how to export as a trigger for object types.  unity:layer for my water type works like a charm and I can navigate to the collider and check isTrigger there and voila, so it's mostly moot, but it doesn't import to unity as a trigger, with or without the unity:isTrigger property, and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if it's a bug or just not supported.  I feel like it'd be pretty cool to be able to have that feature without extra layers and more automapping (Though I love me some automapping).


  Thanks!
