  Hi Sean,


  I have been having a problem where I can successfully import my map into unity with no errors and the preview in Tiled2unity looks right but when I check it in prefabs it's completely blacked out and unity wont allow me to add it into the scene. I can't seem to find a solution to the problem and hope you can help.


  Thanks


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Eric. This was a bug I fixed with version 1.0.7.2 of Tiled2Unity. Thanks.</em>
