  Hi Sean, I have a problem..


  You see, I'm using your amazing tool to put Tiled maps to my unity project, then yesterday, my PC crashed(BSOD) while I'm doing my project, the moment I turn on my PC and open my project, some of the tiles that I was working on was gone.. I'll be glad if you have a fix for this one, my last back-up was 5 days ago and all the work I have done was gone because I can't fix the tiles, Thanks in advance and God Bless always :D
