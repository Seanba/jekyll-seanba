message: Hi! If I import the unitypackage the unity console says "There is an error with your Tiled2Unity install. Could not find Tiled2Unity folder in ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset". But the Tiled2Unity folder is correctly copied in my projects "Assets". What I'm doing wrong? Using Unity 5.3.1f. Greetings from Germany!
