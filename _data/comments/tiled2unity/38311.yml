  Hello,


  So, I was in need of Tiled2Unity for OS X. So thanks to Gnumaru (https://github.com/Gnumaru) work on making it compatible with mono, I was able to make an OS X app.


  So anyone interested in using it on OS X install the Unity Package from the zip already provided and download this app: http://doolsllc.com/Tiled2Unity.zip It will give you a link to install mono.


  (Warning: I did not sign the app, this means you'll have to allow it to run.)
