  I'm a new user to tiled and your utility and I'm having an issue with object properties. I created a test map and added a couple of objects. In each of those objects I added a couple of custom properties. I used your util and imported the data into unity. Everything seems to work like it should, but I don't see the property values anywhere.


  If I look at the xml that was imported into unity, the properties are in the file, but just not shown in unity at all. Is there something else I need to setup to get access to the data in unity?


  thanks. <em> <strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Bill, custom properties need to be acted upon through additional code that you will write in your own Custom Importer class.
