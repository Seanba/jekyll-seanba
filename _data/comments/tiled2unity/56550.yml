  Hello There,


  I'm a big fan of the tool. However, whenever I make a map and try to select it as a file I keep getting this error. Tileset file does not exist: C:\base tileset.tsx


  I created the maps in tiled and I am able to open a sample map I downloaded from somewhere else using the tool. So I'm not entirely sure what I did wrong.
