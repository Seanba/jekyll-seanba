  Hi Sean, I use the latest version of the converter (Download the 0.9.13.1 Win32 Installer here). Layer objects I use to decorate the environment. When you try to move the map in unity5 constantly get an error. When you remove a layer of objects, everything is done correctly. Nowhere did I find the latest version(Version 1.0.0.0)


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> The latest version is always at the top of this post (try the download buttons) </em>
