  Hi Sean


  I've downloaded your software Tiled2unity and It is a very handy tool to create 2D levels in unity. I'am learning more about the tool. The only thing I want to know is 1. I have created a 2D map on tiled and I have saved it as level1.tmx. 2. Then I Opened Tiled2Unity and imported unity package to project. 3. Then I clicked on Export to and I opened Tiled2Unity.export. 4. Then I opened Open tiled level and Clicked on Big Ass Export Button.


  Now I am getting  this Succesfully exported: C:\Users\Sohail's Cmax\Documents\Test\Assets\Tiled2Unity\Imported\Level1.tiled2unity.xml


  I cant see file which i can import into my project.


  I saw a tutorial of GamesplusJames and he easily imported his level in his project.


  Please help me out.
