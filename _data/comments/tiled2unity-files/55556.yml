  Hey there! Not sure if I'm missing something. But I've installed Tiled2Unity to my project (lets say it's at C:/Project/Assets/Tiled2Unity) and I can export to the folder targeting the installed Tiled2Unity.export.txt file.


  I want to export to a different folder (ex: C:/Project/Assets/Levels), but I can only get it to work if I copy over all of the contents inside the Tiled2Unity folder (i.e. the prefabs/materials etc).


  I would like to be able to select the corresponding folder (Levels/Level01) and export the map to there. Then the next map, target Levels/Level02 if I wanted to. But if the above is the only way, then I would have to move the entire folder heirarchy every time, or have copies in every level folder.


  Am I missing something, or is that the only way to change where it exports to? Otherwise, I have move and overwrite the prefab that I'm using in the game, and of course that has the possibility to losing the reference link and other obvious annoyances.


  Thanks for the help!
