  Hello, my name is Pedro, and I am currently on a Game Development Marathon, with final due date to 25/11/2016.


  I have used TILED and TILED2UNITY to create the level for a 2D Platformer.


  All the resources are working fine inside unity, but when we EXPORT TO WEBGL, the assets  get bugged, stop showing entirely or some parts of them vanish/breaks.


  Any advices on a fix, PLEASE?


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> It appears that this is a problem with some WebGL implementations when using NPOT textures. As a rule, try to always use textures that are powers-of-two (64x64, 128x256, 512x512, etc..) for your tilesets. Most platforms don't have this limitation but it's a real pain when it shows up.</em>
