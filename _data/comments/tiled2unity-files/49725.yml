  My unity gets stuck at importing the xml file and says "Error importing texture 'Assets/Tiled2Unity/Textures/8x8_preset4.png'. Could not find material. Try re-importing Tiled2Unity/Imported/[MapName].tiled2unity.xml file"


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Hi Hakan, I recently fixed some problems with texture importing. Can you update to the latest version of Tiled2Unity and try again? (Don't forget to update your Unity-side scripts too)</em>
