  Yo Seanba!


  Do you think you could point me in the right direction? I would really, really like to get some help on C# coding. Anything would be nice -- tips, websites, videos.  I have a degree in Game Production, but my position on my teams was always Creative Director and 2D/3D Artist. I would love to learn how to code, so I can be a "One man team" so to speak. I've done a very limited amount of coding, and I'm just looking for some help.


  Thanks! (Feel free to email me if you'd like.)
