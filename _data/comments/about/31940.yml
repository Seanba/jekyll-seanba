  Somehow I just discovered Tiled about a week ago but not soon after found the amazing work you've done here with Tiled2Unity. You took the time and effort to put your work out there for the rest of us so I figure the least I can do is send a note to say thanks. I'm just a hobbyist (and fellow 80s gamer who cut his teeth on 8-bit classics and spent his allowance 25 cents at a time back in the day). Anyway I think there are few things more worthwhile then sharing your knowledge and experience; What you are doing means something and it really does make a difference.


  I hope you keep up with this project and I will be sure to continue checking in on your latest developments either way - you've got a great no-nonsense but approachable style and it's great to learn that way. I can't speak for the others who have found your work, but you have helped inspire me to keep plugging away at this hobby and to keep making things - to keep trying at least.
