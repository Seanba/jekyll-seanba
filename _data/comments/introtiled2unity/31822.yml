  awesome tool, thanks for making this Seanba.


  One issue i came across. Is that in the Tiled command, if you have white space in your command for example, my project file was in a folder called "Unity Projects" and when Tiled2Unity went to export it error-ed out because it couldn't find the directory. I tried "%" and that didn't work.


  thanks!
