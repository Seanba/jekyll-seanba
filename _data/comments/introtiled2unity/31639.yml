  I sent an email already, but thought I would post here too in case someone else can help.  For some reason I can't get tiled2unity to work.   Every time I try to import a tmx file, I get this error.


  Could not export 'Castle.tiled2unity.xml' Tiled2Unity.unitypackage is not installed in unity project: C:\Users\Ed\Documents\Unity\TimeQuest\TimeQuest\Assets\Tiled2Unity Select "Help -&gt; Import Unity Package to Project" and re-export


  I can assure you the unity package is imported, if I try to import it again using the Help-Import Packge, Unity tells me it is already imported.


  What am I missing?


  Thanks.
