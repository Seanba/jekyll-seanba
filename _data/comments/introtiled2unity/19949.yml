  Hi Shawn, the fix was posted in build 0.9.4.6 (<a href="http://www.seanba.com/tiled2unity" title="download page" rel="nofollow">download page</a>)


  I'll look into the draw order thing this weekend. Hopefully it can be achieved through manipulating the z value of the separate tiles in the mesh.
