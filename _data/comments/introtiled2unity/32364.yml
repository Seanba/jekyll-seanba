  First â€” a big thanks for this utility, Sean!  Along with Unity 5 going free, this plugin really opens the doors for many looking to get into game development, hobby or otherwise... so for that, I'm very thankful!  As I know many other are as  well.  So, thanks again for this Sean! :D


  I do have a question though, if you have a moment to answer!  Just quickly... is there any way to easily import the "Insert Tile" objects placed on Object Layers in Tiled?   I mean, I know they get imported as a "TileObject", which looks promising, but is there a way to have the actual sprite attached to them as well?  Or am I totally missing something?


  Thanks for all the hard work with this Sean, and for the tutorials and support!  May many more wonderful games come into existence because of this :D
