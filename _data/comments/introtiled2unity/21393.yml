  Hi Dawson, check the console/debug output in Unity when you export. There may be some errors there. When I've seen this before it was because a mesh didn't have the proper material assigned to it. Sometimes Unity renames meshes on you and that makes it hard for Tiled2Unity to successfully create the prefab.


  Also, send me your *.tiled2unity.xml file and I'll find some time to look at it.
