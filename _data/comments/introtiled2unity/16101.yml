  Hi,


  I want to use your tool for my game. The export is good, but when I drag&amp;drop the prefab into the scene, all the textures are bad. Everything is in the same color... I've save the map using the last version of Tiled.


  Everything seems fine though, I don't really know what to do, any ideas ? :)


  Thanks !
