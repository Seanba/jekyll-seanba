  Hi,


  I keep running into a problem, when I updated my source image via a graphics program, sometimes it doesnt update in tiled, the path / reference is correct but just doesnt update.


  Even if I edit the tileset and change the source image (to the same one) , it still doesnt update the image to what I have changed and still shows the old version, like its cached
