  I tried out your tool and whenever I do the "Big Ass Export" an error gets generated in Unity3D as follows: InvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object


  at the following line of code in the class ImportTiled2Unity: line 27:            XElement match = assignMaterials.First(el =&gt; el.Attribute("mesh").Value == renderer.name);


  A null then gets thrown after.


  Any ideas of how I can get this working?
