  Cool thanks for the quick response and fix, amazing!


  Regarding the draw order, it should be possible with Unity meshes I think? As 2dToolKit does support any of the 4 render orders (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), and then creates multiple meshes from them, as you can see here: http://cl.ly/image/0G1F1I1l2J01


  If we can't get Tiled to work we'll likely end up using 2DToolKit, (rather than kill the perspective) but would really love to use Tiled as it's much more stable and powerful. Cheers,
