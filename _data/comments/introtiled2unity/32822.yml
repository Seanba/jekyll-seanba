  Hello Guys, this tool looks awesome, how can i make it work in Mac? I saw people asking around but no news :(, it's strange that there is no MAC support. Im not a Unity expert, im just doing a game for my daughter and doing maps is actually the hardest and boring part without a tool like this one.
