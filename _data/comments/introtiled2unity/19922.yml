  Hi, first off thanks for the amazing looking plugin, it seems amazingly robust and powerful.


  However, every time I try and load a TMX file, I'm getting errors: System.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains no elements at System.Linq.Enumerable.First[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source) at Tiled2Unity.TmxMap.ParseInternalTileset(XElement elemTileset, UInt32 firstId) at Tiled2Unity.TmxMap.ParseExternalTileset(String tsxPath, UInt32 firstId)


  I can load a completely empty scene. But as soon as I add even a single tile, I get this error. It must have something to do with our TileSet?


  Here's a link to the test scene w/ our tile set: https://www.dropbox.com/s/f7ydyfl9l1mk86o/TiledTestScene.zip
