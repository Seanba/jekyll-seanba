  Ok,


  I've done it. It's working now, after I had set the texture of the "mesh_[00]_[00]" inside of the shader-component. I don't know if this is the best way to do it, but it's working.


  It would be very nice, if I could change the default FilterMode for imported textures. Is this possible anyway?
