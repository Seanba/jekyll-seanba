  Hi Seanba, excellent work!


  Your introduction implies to me that there must be some way to use orthographic code to implement a tilemap that looks like an isometric one. I tried to draw it myself but failed, neither have I found anything related on the internet. Could you give me some hint pls? Thanks!


  <em><strong>Seanba sez</strong>: Hi Arthur, I'm looking into what it would take to add isometric support to Tiled2Unity. I get asked often enough about it that I think it's worth supporting. Stay tuned.</em>
