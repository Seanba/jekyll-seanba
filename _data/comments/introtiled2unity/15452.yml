  Matthew, I think the problem stems from your tile layer ("Tile Layer 1") having whitespace in it. It looks like Unity forced the mesh to be named "Tile_Layer 1" (note only the first space was replaced with an underscore, I don't know the rhyme or reason for it).


  If you rename your layers in Tiled to not have whitespace then I think it will work. In the meantime, I'll look into handling this case. Thanks for the bug report.
