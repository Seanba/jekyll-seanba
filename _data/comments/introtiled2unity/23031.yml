  I hope I can phrase this question correctly. I am making a sidescroller, and what I want to do is just import the entire map into unity: for example: http://ian-albert.com/games/super_mario_bros_maps/mario-1-1.gif if I used that map of super mario and dragged it into my scene, how do I correlate the sprites to my sprite sheet so I can tell each sprite what to use for rigid2dbody collision?


  Or is what I want even possible?


  hope this makes sense


  Thank you
