  Thank you Seanba for your answer.


  sorry, could you please explain the required procedure in detail?


  I've imported a copy of the used .png file into my textures folder (Assets/Resources/Textures) with "FilterMode" = Bilinear and re-imported the level with Tiled2Unity. When I'm starting the game, then everything is looking the same as before.
