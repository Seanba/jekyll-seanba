  Sorry, to bug, but could you tell me how I'd go about adding support for Render Order?


  The latest builds of Tiled allow you to specify drawing from Bottom-Right, rather than Top-Left, which we require for out art style.


  However the mesh always seems to be rendered from top-left: http://cl.ly/image/29251u0Z3Y1Q
