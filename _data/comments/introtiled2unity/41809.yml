  Hey Sean,


  Keep getting this error when exporting to latest Unity. Prefab is also not showing up. Wondering if you have any suggestions.


  'Importing 'Assets/Tiled2Unity/Imported/First Map.tiled2unity.xml' but Tiled2Unity files cannot be imported with the WebPlayer[deprecated] platform. However, You can use Tiled2Unity prefabs imported by another platform. UnityEngine.Debug:LogWarning(Object)


  Hope all is well!


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Unity has stopped supporting the Unity Web Player (it will be removed wholesale with Unity 5.4, thank god). In the meantime you can press CTRL+SHIFT+B in Unity and switch your build platform away from the Web Player. I suggest PC, Mac & Linux.</em>
