  Hi Wax, that aliasing is likely due to the point sampling for the textures used. When textures are imported into a Unity project by Tiled2Unity they are forced to point sampling. I do this because I'm going for a "pixel perfect" look.


  You can trick out the system by having those textures *inside* your Unity project to start off with. In that case Tiled2Unity trusts your texture settings. You could then set your textures for bilinear filtering and see if that looks better.
