  It seems to be a great Tool, but it doesnt work on my Computer (Unity Version 2017.1.0f3) I installed the Unity-Package, but it tells me everytime:


  Could not export 'Test2.tiled2unity.xml' Tiled2Unity.unitypackage is not installed in unity project: D:\Unity-Programme\RPG Select "Help -&gt; Import Unity Package to Project" and re-export


  Has anyone any Idea, how I could solve it?
