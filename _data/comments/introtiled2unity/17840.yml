  Hello Slepice1, the <strong>Tile Collision Editor</strong> is a beta feature of Tiled and requires you to download a special build. I talk about that in this post:


  <blockquote>This Tiled feature is currently in beta so youâ€™ll need to get a version of the program from the daily builds here: http://files.mapeditor.org/daily/</blockquote>
