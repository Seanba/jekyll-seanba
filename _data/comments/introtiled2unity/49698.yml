  I am having the issue that was mentioned earlier, where there's an xml fille generated. There are, however, no prefabs.


  I found this in the Log: Writing face uv coordinates when I noticed that the "clipping" output log had no file listed.


  ImportTexture : will import 'C:\Users\Bobby\Documents\UnityDataTools\Art\Unsorted\cute_lpc_revised.png' to C:\Users\Bobby\Documents\UnityDataTools\Projects\DoNE\DoNE\Assets\Tiled2Unity\Assets\Tiled2Unity\Textures\




  It's attempting to import an image from a working directory path to a directory path that doesn't exist within the Tiled2Unity package.


  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the package, deleting the entire folder its files are in. Doesn't matter. It keeps trying to pull things to the wrong directories. Even after I manually imported the image into the directory, it still wouldn't create the prefab.


  I'm guessing I did something simple to point it to the wrong place. I've been over the directions more than a dozen times, but then my brain's in pieces from reading switch logs all day (network IT by day, n00b video game dev hobbyist by night).


  Any help would be hugely appreciated. Thanks.


  <em><strong>Seanba sez:</strong> Tiled2Unity was reporting that texture being copied to the wrong diretory and is now fixed.</em>
