message: Hello, I've got a very simple use case for this, that is my characters move like in an old-school RPG (one tile at a time), and I don't necessarily want to use the generated collision mesh for this purpose. Is it possible to get access to the source tile data for this (so my characters can just do a simple tile check when they move)? Or would I have to write my own exporter for Tiled?
