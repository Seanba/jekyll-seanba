message: Man!  This is the best game development tool I've downloaded in all my life!  (and I'm very old!) I've been searching for a way to get Tiled into Unity on and off for years and I can't believe I've never found this before -- Unity and Tiled should be shouting it from their respective roof-tops. Very, very, very well done Sean. We have 7 years worth of art assets and a massive tiled world-in-progress for a castlevania style game and I've just been unable to pick a dev platform.. the internet is full of over-hyped game engines (you know.. that ones that claim to do everything on every platform.. either right before they die or actually, six months in, you find they lied).  I honestly contemplated writing my own (again! but this time with mobile targets and a non-fixed-function-rendering pipeline [see, I told you I was old!]) but you've just cemented Unity as the way forward for us.  I owe you big time and I always pay my debts.  You'll be hearing a lot from me in due course :) Thank you!  Just, thank you! (I took me two hours from downloading your tool to figuring how to get my map running with collisions.  I'm truly blown away!)
