  David, in the past I would get untextured tiles because Unity would decorate the mesh name to something Tiled2Unity wasn't expecting. Do you see any warnings or errors in the log/output window in Unity?


  If there's nothing obvious there I can try to export your TMX file (and textures) to see if I can replicate the issue.
