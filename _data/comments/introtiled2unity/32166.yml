  Alan, I'll be putting together a tutorial on this kind of thing soon but here's the gist of it ...


  You can't get at the individual tile but you can create a collision mesh for every tile "type" and do a raycast to see what kind of tile type your avatar is currently placed on top of.


  But, that requires you to have different tile types on individual layers in Tiled. That is a PITA but you can use Tiled Automapping to automatically create those layers for you.


  Then, as you're only interested in the collision data from those layers you can use the <code>unity:collisionOnly</code> property so that the collision for those layers is imported into Unity -- but not the mesh that would make up those extra layers.


  This sounds complicated at first but isn't that bad. Hopefully I can have a tutorial up this weekend that helps explain better.
