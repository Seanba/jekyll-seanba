  This is really awesome, and so quick to implement into unity. Is there a way to set the scale of the map from the import tool? Otherwise i have to make some manual tweaks to the scale after its imported.


  Also for those who had issues with the Tile Collision editor menu not functioning in Tiled, try creating a new map in Tiled. I had an issue editing the Tile collisions with the example maps, but with my own new map this worked perfectly.
