  Hi Matthew. The exporter will have generated a *.unity2tiled.xml file and placed it in your Assets/Tiled2Unity/Imported directory. Do you mind sending it to me? If possible, please send me your Tiled map files too.


  For some reason, it looks like your Tiled map, when exported, is not sending along tileset information. Is it possible your exporting a map with all tile layers set to invisible? (It doesn't look like I'm catching that case, I'll fix that.)
