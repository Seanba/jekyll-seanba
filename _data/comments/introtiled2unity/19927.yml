  Interestingly, even when I removed the collider, allowing the exporter to run, it was still not rendering properly. Tiles were missing and/or incorrect in the generated mesh.


  The main may be that I used a SpriteSheet from TexturePacker, which was exported as a 128x256 POT (Power of Two) texture, meaning it contained a bunch of whitespace, it seems like Tiled creates indexes for these empty tiles, and that this somehow breaks the Exporters tile indexing system.


  As soon as I switched to "Any Size" in texturePacker, which trims all whitespace, everything began working properly.
