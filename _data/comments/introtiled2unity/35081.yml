  My map generates right but the big ass export button says: Could not export 'level1.tiled2unity.xml' Tiled2Unity.unitypackage is not installed in unity project: s:\Projects\dont_steal_my_game_name\ Select "Help -&gt; Import Unity Package to Project" and re-export


  I do have it on drive S: not C: thats not a typo.
