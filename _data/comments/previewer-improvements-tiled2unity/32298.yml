  @Adam The terrain tool solves a quite specific terrain tiling use-case and won't help with this particular problem. While the automapping is indeed more complicated to set up, it is also much more versatile.


  Both tools could be improved (for example the automapping could use a preview and the terrain tool could use support for roads and fences), but they will remain different tools for solving different problems.
