  @Marcus: No doubt you're proud of your brother and the rest of the band. They do great work.


  I've seen them 3 times now (twice with my daughter) and will certainly be seeing them again. It's always a good show - and I really appreciate them recognizing us whenever we make it to one of their gigs.


  Yeah, my daughter is super cool about this stuff. What can I say? I love it.
