  I caught them at Game Over and at Genuine Joe's. They rocked both places! My grandson was at the second show and sat in the front row. He loved the Mario medley and asked if they could add some stuff from the Sonic games to the set list.


  This is a great little band that we are lucky to be able to catch for free. I would happily pay to see them, as they are HOT.


  Let's hope they play again at the upcoming Game Over Summer Video Game Tournaments. I first heard them there last year and have been following them ever since.
