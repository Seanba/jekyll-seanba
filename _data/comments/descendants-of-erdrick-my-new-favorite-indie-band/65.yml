  My brother is D of 's bassist, and I'm really proud of him and the rest of the band for all the hard work they put into their music and that they could inspire such positive emotions in people like yourselves.  I hope I can go to Austin at some point and see them play.


  By the way, Sean, I read the part where your daughter correctly identified Terra's Theme and it made me happy.  I hope to have a kid that awesome someday.
