  - My wife makes me pancakes shaped like Mickey Mouse, in honor of my work on Disney Epic Disney. I love the simplicity of it, and wonder how that kind of thinking can be used to make better video games.

Team Barton has a ritual every Sunday morning where the kids let the grown-ups sleep in a bit and the family is rewarded with pancakes afterwards.

(And yes, we allow &#8211; no, encourage &#8211; the children to spend these mornings watching TV. Don’t approve? Get bent.)

**Anyway, the pancakes:** They taste great, and they’re served with Canadian maple syrup – but other than that they’re just regular pancakes with no extra ingredients, sides, or frills*.

Now there’s always a lot of talk of [Disney Epic Mickey](http://disney.go.com/disneyinteractivestudios/product.html?platform=wii&game=disneyepicmickey) around our house**, and lately there’s been even more than usual, so my wife decided to put a little bit of that Disney magic into my breakfast. **Introducing Disney Epic Pancakes:**

[<img title="I just love the simplicity displayed here with the Mickey-shaped pancakes." alt="Mickey-shaped pancakes" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mickeypancakes_thumb.jpg" width="640" height="314" />](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mickeypancakes.jpg)

I have to admit, I really was touched by the gesture, and the kids got a huge laugh out of it too. I’m also struck by the pure simplicity of it. Just two additional globs of pancake mix and there you have it!

And because I just have to over-analyze everything I couldn’t help but think of a way to tie this into some kind of career advice or something.

**So here’s my tortured motivation for the day:** We game developers do an exceptional job at conjuring ideas, features, and tasks that &#8211; although potentially cool &#8211; eat up a lot of time and money, increase project complexity, and introduce tremendous risk towards our goal of shipping great video game software. Let’s try harder to **identify some absolutely kickass items that take virtually no effort** to achieve instead.
