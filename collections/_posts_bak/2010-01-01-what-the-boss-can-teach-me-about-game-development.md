I barely ever watch broadcast television, much less enjoy it, so it was a nice surprise to accidently come across [The Kennedy Center Honors](http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/index.cfm) the other evening just long enough to notice that [Bruce Springsteen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen) (amongst others) was being inducted.

I've always liked the man Springsteen, from what little I can really know about the person, but it takes the speech crafting of someone as talented as Jon Stewart (who honored Springsteen that evening) [to explain why](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jqNXphenus):

> Whenever I see Bruce Springsteen do anything he empties the tank ... _every time_.

Yep, that's it. I just can't help but be drawn to someone who has such passion for what they do.

I know it's a stretch to tie this into the kind of message I want for my blog about making better video game software, but we're all back at the office in a couple of days after a nice break and I'm thinking of what motivation to bring with me in order to launch the year strong.

**Here it is:** First, I want to make sure I'm always in the right direction and working on something of good value to me, [my team](http://www.junctionpoint.com/), and [our game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Mickey). And second, once that direction is secured … **empty the tank**.

There, that’s about the closest I can ever come to a New Year’s resolution. Happy 2010.
