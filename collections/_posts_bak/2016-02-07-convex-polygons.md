I've said this before but I think the single best feature in Tiled2Unity isÂ the `PolygonCollider2D` instances that are created fromÂ Tiled layers, where the colliders on each tile are merged into one big polygon.Â Concave edges? Holes? Not a problem.

<div id="attachment_1154" style="width: 535px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-1154" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wbml-concave-holes.png" alt="Wonder Boy in Monster World, Concave Colliders" width="525" height="333" srcset="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wbml-concave-holes.png 525w, /assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wbml-concave-holes-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    In this scene from Wonder Boy in Monster World, the room colliders are just one big polygon with concave edges and a hole in the middle. It's a great way to represent the collisions but some code may not work with it.
  </p>
</div>

However, some users would like to use the `PolygonCollider2D` instances created by Tiled2Unity and feed them into another Unity script or plugin that performs pathfinding, or real-time lighting, or whatever. The problem is, these other plugins commonlyÂ only work with polygons that are convex.

And by the way, if that's a plugin you _bought_Â with actual _money_Â from the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/)Â then I think that's weak sauce. Tell those guys to fix their tools!

But I digress ... with the latest Tiled2Unity versionÂ you can now set an option to haveÂ **only convex polygons exported**.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1157" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/t2u-convex-checkbox.png" alt="Convex Polygon Option" width="572" height="104" srcset="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/t2u-convex-checkbox.png 572w, /assets/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/t2u-convex-checkbox-300x55.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" />

**Note:** Convex polygon output can be also be set through the `-c` or `--convex`Â options for those of you using the command line.

This will increase the number of `PolygonCollider2D` components in yourÂ Tiled prefabs but through theÂ [Hertel-Mehlhorn Algorithm](https://www8.cs.umu.se/kurser/TDBA77/VT06/algorithms/BOOK/BOOK5/NODE194.HTM) I've made that numberÂ &#8220;reasonably&#8221; low. For most cases I'd be surprised if there was a noticeable change inÂ performance.

    With the Convex Polygon Colliders option enabled we have replaced the one &#8220;complex&#8221; polygon with seven convex polygons. This is an increase in prefab complexity but at least we can use it with other scripts that are limited to convex polygons.

## Different Ways to Set Convex Polygon Output

There is some flexibility when it comes to enabling convex polygon exporting:

  * **Tiled2Unity Utility:** Either use the `Convex Polygon Colliders` checkbox in the Win32 utility or use the `-c|--convex` command line option. This will be the preferred setting for exporting polygons for all maps.
  * **Tiled Map:** Add a property named `unity:convex` to your Map Properties in Tiled set to `true` or `false`. This will be the preferred setting for all the layers in your map and will override the setting from the Tiled2Unity utility.
  * **Tiled Layer:** Add the `unity:convex` property to your Layer Properties. This willÂ be the final word on how the polygons in your layer will be exported, overriding the map and utility preferences.

**Make sure to keep these precedence rules in mind.** If you set `unity:convex` to `true` or `false` in a Tiled layer, for instance, then this will always be obeyed, no matter how you &#8220;prefer&#8221; to export maps in the Tiled2Unity Utility.

As always (and especially with a new feature such as this) you can email me any bugs you come across and I'll find the spare time to address them. Just be aware a full-time game development which slows me down at times. ðŸ™‚
