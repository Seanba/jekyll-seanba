According to a report [cited by Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26635/Report_1099_Games_Released_In_2009_Up_Slightly_From_2008.php), there was a staggering 1,099 console video games released to retail this past year.

And of course half of them were either [Rock Band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band) or [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_hero) properties, am I right? ðŸ™‚

Anyway, today I took stock of the retail games that I purchased or were gifted to me in 2009 â€¦

  * 12 Xbox 360 games
  * 4 Nintendo DS games
  * 2 Nintendo GBA games
  * 1 Wii game<sup>*</sup>

Nineteen games? I would have figured a number much smaller than that. Hey, Iâ€™m an enthusiastic gamer and all, but we developers have a large network of gamers to borrow from and free access to a large library of titles at work. So look at me being a good American consumer anyway. During a recession, no less. Capitalism!

I donâ€™t know exactly how many games your average console owner buys, but it is certainly a much smaller number. When I worked for Microsoft I remember our marketing guys claiming consumers buy, on average, 9 retail-priced games for each console they own â€“ **during the lifetime of the platform**. Incidentally, this is how Nintendo \** and Microsoft and Sony make money on their consoles, through the license fees of a meager 10 or so new (i.e. not from the used rack or bargain bin) video games over a 5 year run. Sony would do well to remember that before releasing another $600 console.

[<img class="sba-align-left" title="Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/modernwarfare2box.jpg" alt="Modern Warfare 2 box art" width="185" height="240" />](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Warfare_2)

To me, with your average console owner buying maybe 4 new games annually \*** in a year with 1,099 titles to chose from, thereâ€™s a very sad truth to be found: **Thereâ€™s a lot of game developers taking a severe pounding out there.** And this is only for the developers _that actually ship a product_ and have to compete with [Modern Warfare 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Warfare_2) for shelf space.

There might have been a day where you could wander aimlessly with a schedule and some money and a room full of gaming geeks to release a game to market and hope for the best â€¦ but that day has long gone by. **This is serious business.**

I truly believe that rule number one for our business is that **we must find fun in our work** (really, why even bother with it otherwise?) â€¦ but itâ€™s also a tough industry that requires us to be a little bit grown up about it too.

Good luck in 2010 to all my developer buddies.

    * Looking back, Iâ€™m a bit surprised the Wii games didnâ€™t compete better for my dollars. But then again, it was a relatively weak year, with respect to the games I prefer, for that platform.Â <br /> ** Yeah, I know. Nintendo actually turns a profit on console hardware sales alone. Sony and Microsoft take note.Â <br /> *** Iâ€™m being generous here because that statistic is a bit old and many homes have more than one console.
