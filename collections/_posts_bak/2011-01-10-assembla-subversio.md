A couple of years ago I decided to move all my hobby source code from my local Subversion service to an online service.

My needs were pretty simple:

  * Interface locally through a Subversion client (like [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/))
  * At least 500MB, but the more the better
  * Private, with SSL encryption
  * And, like my email, free

[Assembla](http://www.assembla.com/) was highly recommended by peers, but wasn’t free, so I went with something else that fit the bill. Since then this service moved their ideal free, private, secure, 500MB, ad-free package to a less attractive free, private, non-secure, 200MB one – and with badly aligned, eyesore advertisements to boot.

Not that I can really blame them, mind you. They do need to make money, and it’s not like I program for free (at my day job anyhow). So no hard feelings.

But it turns out that [Assembla is now offering a free plans](http://offers.assembla.com/free/) so I’m trying them on for size. Their [free SVN hosting](http://offers.assembla.com/free-subversion-hosting/) is private and secure – and currently comes with a 2GB data store which is more than enough for my hobby projects that tend to be heavy on code and light on artistic resources.

It’s early into my relationship with Assembla, but at first blush I’m impressed with how easy it was to [create a new repository](https://www.assembla.com/features/popup_video?video=12) and start adding code to it. I also appreciate their online dashboard for being well-designed, clean, and functional. You’ll see some ads there, but they are respectfully out of the way.

We’ll see how it goes, but so far so good.
