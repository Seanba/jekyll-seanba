I’ve been waiting a long to get my hands on <a title="Unity 5" href="http://unity3d.com/5" rel="Unity 5">Unity 5</a> and I’m happy to see that <a title="Unity Technologies" href="http://unity3d.com/company" rel="Unity Technologies">Unity Technologies</a> has followed the lead from <a title="Unreal 4" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4" rel="Unreal 4">Epic’s Unreal 4 Engine</a> and has made their full product free to hobbyist developers &#8212; not that you needed any of the professional features to use Tiled2Unity.

I’m also happy to announce that the <a title="Tiled2Unity" href="{{ '/tiled2unity/' | relative_url }}" rel="Tiled2Unity">latest version of Tiled2Unity</a> is compliant with Unity 5. Enjoy.

**Update for Unity 4.x users:** This update had inadvertently broken scripts for those of you that haven’t jumped to Unity 5 yet – a completely plausible scenario given Unity 5 is less than a week old. I just put up a new version of Tiled2Unity that supports both versions. Sorry for the inconvenience.

**For Visual Studio users**: When switching between versions of Unity I’ve found that I often have to delete the solution files and have Unity regenerate them. Try that if you are still getting compile errors.
