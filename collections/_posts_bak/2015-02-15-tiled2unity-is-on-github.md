**Update:** Tiled2Unity is now officially supported on Mac and Linux platforms as a command line utility through [Tiled2UnityLite]({{ '/introducing-tiled2unitylite/' | relative_url }}.html).

In keeping with my decision to keep <a title="Tiled2Unity" href="{{ '/tiled2unity/' | relative_url }}" rel="Tiled2Unity">Tiled2Unity</a> free and choosing the permissive <a title="MIT License" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" rel="MIT License">MIT License</a> for it I have recently put all the source up <a title="Tiled2Unity on GitHub" href="https://github.com/Seanba/Tiled2Unity" rel="Tiled2Unity on GitHub">on a public GitHub repository</a>.

**Full disclosure**: I’m new to GitHub so bear with me if I make a mess of it. I’m a long-timer user of <a title="Perforce" href="http://www.perforce.com/" rel="Perforce">Perforce</a> and <a title="Subversion" href="https://subversion.apache.org/" rel="Subversion">Subversion</a> and have been a bit of a dinosaur when it comes to <a title="Git" href="http://git-scm.com/" rel="Git">Git</a>.
