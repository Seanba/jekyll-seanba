Today I was treated to my usual Sunday morning pancakes on top of my Father’s Day present. Pretty cool, no?

[<img title="Great Father's Day gift: Now I can watch Mario and Optimus Prime while I eat!" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/optimusmarioplate_thumb.jpg" alt="Optimus Prime vs Mario Dinner Plate" width="505" height="480" />](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/optimusmarioplate.jpg)

There’s just so much awesomeness in this:

  * My four-year-old drew Optimus Prime on the left (with very little help from my wife, I’m told).
  * Josie also scribbled “Optimus Daddy” on the bottom. Too cute.
  * Ella, our seven-year-old, drew Mario by hand alone. What detail!
  * Ella added one of the stars from Super Mario Galaxy – our favorite Daddy-Daughter video gaming experience of all time.
  * _“We think to ourselves, Supper Mario Daddy”_ is a play on Brentalfloss’ [_Super Mario World_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTRzaG_GbVQ) song, which in itself is a play on [_What a Wonderful World_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Y2zdyRin8) by Louis Armstrong. **Yes, my kids are that meta.**
  * Ella even replaced the word “Super” with “Supper” on purpose. Awesome!

They obviously put a lot of thought, time, and love into making me this. What incredible girls I have. Not to brag, but man do I ever have it made &#8211; it should be illegal to live a life so filled with joy.

**Happy Father’s Day indeed!**
