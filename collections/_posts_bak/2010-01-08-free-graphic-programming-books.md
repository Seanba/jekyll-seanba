I recently discovered a listing of free graphic programming books via [GameRendering.com](http://www.gamerendering.com/2009/12/10/great-free-graphics-programming-books/). A couple are a bit dated but are still good resources on graphic hardware programming and the mathematical concepts behind (advanced) lighting and shadowing techniques.

  * [Programming Vertex, Geometry, and Pixel Shaders: 2nd Edition](http://wiki.gamedev.net/index.php/D3DBook:Book_Cover)
  * [Direct3D ShaderX Vertex and Pixel Shader Tips and Tricks](http://tog.acm.org/resources/shaderx/Direct3D.ShaderX.Vertex.and.Pixel.Shader.Tips.and.Tricks_Wolfgang.F.Engel_Wordware.Pub_2002.pdf)
  * [ShaderX2: Introductions and Tutorials with DirectX 9](http://tog.acm.org/resources/shaderx/Introductions_and_Tutorials_with_DirectX_9.pdf)
  * [ShaderX2: Shader Programming Tips &Tricks with DirectX 9](http://tog.acm.org/resources/shaderx/Tips_and_Tricks_with_DirectX_9.pdf)
  * [The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html)
  * [GPU Gems](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_part01.html)
  * [GPU Gems 2](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_part01.html)
  * [GPU Gems 3](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpu-gems-3.html)

(The first book is actually pretty new and covers DirectX 10. It is free while the authors work out a publishing deal. They would appreciate you purchase a print version when available.)

By the way, why [Nvidia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia) put some bald dudeâ€™s ugly head on the cover of their latest GPU Gems book instead of one of those pretty little fairies theyâ€™re famous for is beyond me.

[<img title="GPU Gems 3 - Now with ugly bald dude" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/gpugems31.jpg" alt="GPU Gems 3" width="317" height="400" />](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_part01.html)

GPU Gems 3 has a chapter on the [deferred shading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading) solution [used in Tabula Rasa](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch19.html), the last published game I both shipped and [said good-bye to]({{ '/a-killed-mmo-how-very-rude/' | relative_url }}.html). The article was written by our client lead, and one of my mentors, Rusty Koonce. He was gracious enough to give me a prop in that book:

> _I would like to thank all of the contributors to this chapter, including a few at NCsoft Austin who also have helped make our rendering engine possible: Sean Barton, Tom Gambill, Aaron Otstott, John Styes, and Quoc Tran._

Thatâ€™s nice, but make no mistake, Rusty was the _real_ brains behind it. Well, and maybe John too. ðŸ˜‰

Incidentally, Aaron is working on [Star Wars: The Old Republic](http://www.swtor.com/), John is on [DC Universe Online](http://dcuo.station.sony.com/), and Quoc and I are with the [Disney Epic Mickey](http://disney.go.com/disneyinteractivestudios/product.html?platform=wii&game=disneyepicmickey) team. Did I ever mention how cool this industry is?
