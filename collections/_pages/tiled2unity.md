Tiled2Unity is a free utility with one goal in mind: **Easy exporting of Tiled Map Editor TMX files into your Unity projects.**
Tiled2Unity takes your Tiled files and creates Unity prefabs from them that are easily placed into your Unity scene.
Complex collision is supported through Unityâ€™s [PolygonCollider2D](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PolygonCollider2D.html) class. (Windows and Mac)

Tiled2UnityLite is a command line version of the Tiled2Unity utility.
It can be used on any platform but was primarily designed to give Linux users a way to use Tiled2Unity on their operating system.

#### Updating Tiled2Unity

When you install a new Tiled2Unity version you will also want to update the Tiled2Unity scripts in your Unity project folder as well.
The easiest way to accomplish this is through the `Import Unity Package to Project` menu item while your project is open in Unity.

**Note:** Both the Tiled2Unity output window and the Unity console will complain if there is a mismatch.

#### All Source is Freely Available on GitHub

Tiled2Unity is made up of two parts:
1. The Tiled2Unity utility that exports a Tiled file.
2. The Tiled2Unity Unity scripts that imports the *.tiled2unity.xml files and puts the textures, meshes, and prefabs into your Unity project.

Both components are [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/Seanba/Tiled2Unity).
