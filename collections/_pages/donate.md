I consider myself lucky to have such a fun career in game development and, as such, I'm happy to make my tools available to everyone through the *Name Your Price, No Minimum* model.

However, if my tools or insights have saved you time and pain then you may consider making a donation as a way of thanks.

**Low on funds?** Don't sweat it. A nice email or comment is always appreciated too. :blush:

For the record, **I tell every single advertiser or sponsored content affiliate that reaches out to me to get bent**. The only money I make off this website is through your genorosity.

**Thanks for the consideration!**
