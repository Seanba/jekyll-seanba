**Aseprite2Unity** is my custom-built tool made to seamlessly import Aseprite sprites and animations into Unity.

Aseprite2Unity is super simple to use. **Just save your Aseprite files into your Unity project.**
The resulting prefab can be added to your scenes with sprites and animations already created for you. Need to make a change? **No problem!** Just make your edits in Aseprite and resave.

**Important links:**
- Online documentation can be found [on Read the Docs](https://aseprite2unity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- All source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Seanba/Aseprite2Unity). **Please report any bugs here.**

I enjoy [my life as a professional game developer](about.html) and therefore make my tools available for free.
I only ask that you [consider making a donation](donate.html) should my tools become an essential part of your own journey.

**Thank-you and enjoy!**
