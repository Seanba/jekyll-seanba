I'm Sean Barton, a skinny little nerdy kid that grew up in a small mining town in Canada but now lives and works in Austin, Texas with my wife, two daughters, and two dogs.
We are all Texan-Canadian hybrids now. Well, except for the dogs.

(Speaking of dogs, **can you do all our furry friends a favor**? Check out your [local animal shelters first](https://theshelterpetproject.org/) when looking for canine or feline companions. Thanks!)

## My Career

In 1999 I started my career as a game developer with the now-defunct [Digital Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Anvil) 
which became part of the Microsoft Game Studios group.
I later worked for [NCsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSoft), 
[Spacetime Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_Studios), 
and [Junction Point Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_Point_Studios) (part of Disney Interactive).

## Current Job

I now serve as the lead developer at 22nd Century Toys - a small but really cool company I formed with other Disney alumni in 2013.
As a toymaker I get to work on a lot of fun AAA and indie titles. I think it's pretty neat that I get to work on games like Borderlands and Mafia III as well as
Night in the Woods and Enter the Gungeon - it's a nice range.
