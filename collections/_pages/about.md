I'm Sean Barton, a skinny little nerdy kid that grew up in a small mining town in Canada but now lives and works in Austin, Texas with my wife, two daughters, and two dogs.
We are all Texan-Canadian hybrids now. Well, except for the dogs.


In 1999 I started my career as a game developer with the now-defunct [Digital Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Anvil) 
which became part of the Microsoft Game Studios initiative (now called [Microsoft Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Studios)).

Since then I've worked for NCsoft, Spacetime Studios, and Disney Interactive. I now serve as the lead developer at 22nd Century Toys - a small but really cool company I formed with other Disney alumni in 2013.
This is how I get paid to work in video games now without having to work late nights and weekends.
