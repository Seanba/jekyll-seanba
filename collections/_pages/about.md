I'm Sean Barton, a skinny little nerdy kid that grew up in a small mining town in Canada but now lives and works in Austin, Texas with my wife, two daughters, and two dogs.
We are all Texan-Canadian hybrids now. Well, except for the dogs.


In 1999 I started my career as a game developer with the now-defunct [Digital Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Anvil) 
which became part of the Microsoft Game Studios initiative (now called [Microsoft Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Studios)). 
I later worked for NCsoft, Spacetime Studios, and Junction Point Studios (part of Disney Interactive).

**Digital Anvil / Microsoft**
  * [Conquest: Frontier Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest:_Frontier_Wars) (PC)
  * [Brute Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_Force_(video_game)) (Xbox)

**NCsoft**
  * [Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Rasa_(video_game)) (PC MMO)

**Junction Point Studios / Disney**
 * [Disney Epic Mickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Mickey) (Wii)
 * [Disney Epic Micket 2 : The Power of Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Mickey_2:_The_Power_of_Two) (PC, Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, Vita)


I now serve as the lead developer at 22nd Century Toys - a small but really cool company I formed with other Disney alumni in 2013.
As a toymaker I get to work on a lot of fun AAA and indie titles. I think it's pretty neat that I get to work on games like Borderlands and Mafia III as well as
Night in the Woods and Enter the Gungeon - it's a nice range.





fixit - more, better content. Like what I'm into when I'm not working. (also need links above)
