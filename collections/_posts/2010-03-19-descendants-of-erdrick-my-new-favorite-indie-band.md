This evening I took a night out with a fellow video game enthusiast and very special lady (read: my 7-year-old daughter) to see a homegrown video game tribute band: [Descendants of Erdrick](http://descendantsoferdrick.com/).

**Fun fact:** The band name is a cute throwback to the NES [Dragon Warrior games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest), where the heroes are descendants of the legendary hero, [Erdrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest#Loto.2FErdrick).

Anyway, **we had a great time** at the show and were treated to music from these classic games:

  * [Chrono Trigger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger) 
  * [Dragon Warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior) (obviously) 
  * [The Legend of Zelda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)) 
  * [Little Nemo: The Dream Master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nemo:_Dream_Master) 
  * [Final Fantasy 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_4) 
  * [Final Fantasy 6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI) 
  * [Final Fantasy Mystic Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Mystic_Quest) 
  * [Mega Man 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_3) 
  * [Metroid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_(video_game)) 
  * [Ninja Gaiden 2: The Dark Sword of Chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_II:_The_Dark_Sword_of_Chaos) 
  * [Street Fighter 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_2) 
  * [Super Mario Bros.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) 
  * [T&C Surf Designs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%26C_Surf_Designs:_Wood_%26_Water_Rage) 
  * [Wizards & Warriors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_and_Warriors) 

Yes, there‚Äôs some gutsy picks in that setlist (T&C Surf Designs?) but I‚Äôm just a bit sore they didn‚Äôt have any pieces from [The Legacy of the Wizard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkdOyiuG6VY). üôÇ

The highlight for my daughter, easily, was when they played the ever-pleasing Zelda music. I‚Äôve always been a huge Final Fantasy 6 fan though, so I was moved by their rendition of Terra‚Äôs Theme ‚Äì especially when my 7-year-old turned to me and correctly identified that piece of music as ‚Äúthe part where they‚Äôre walking in the snow in robots, right Daddy?‚Äù

Wow. What a great kid.  üôÇ

I got to meet with the band briefly after the show and they were absolutely overwhelmed by the positive response they got from the crowd. I think they‚Äôre just so new that they don‚Äôt yet realize the value their art is providing to gamers that grew up on these titles.

And for me there a bit of extra value as I kept thinking of these two points as they played ‚Ä¶

  1. **Holy crap do I ever love video games.** 
  2. **I‚Äôve never been happier to be making video games for a living.** 

‚Ä¶ what a great message to be bringing with me back to the office after the March break.

By the way, some of their music is available on [their myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/descendantsoferdrick "Descendants of Erdrick on myspace") but quite honestly I don‚Äôt think it does them justice. The enthusiasm and energy and love for what they do was much more pronounced on the makeshift stage tonight. **I highly recommend you seek them out in a live venue.**

With Austin‚Äôs status as the live music capital of the world with a large video game development community it‚Äôs a wonder a band like this hasn‚Äôt popped up before. What a great opportunity for this talented group. I hope they do well.

**Edit:** Many thanks go to Austin‚Äôs own [Game Over Videogames](http://gameovervideogames.com/) for hosting this free event.
