It seems like every holiday break I prove to myself just how badly I need a career in order to keep myself alive and functional.

I’m reminded of an old [Spirit of the West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_the_West) song, titled [Home for a Rest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_for_a_Rest), which is well known to my fellow Canadian ex-pats:

> You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
  
> I've been gone for a week, I've been drunk since I left
  
> These so-called vacations will soon be my death
  
> I'm so sick from the drink, I need home for a rest.

Except in my case I haven’t been drinking myself stupid, but I did **play the living hell** out of some great video games. And now I’ve trained myself to sleep between 4am and 12pm plus I’ve got a throbbing headache at the back of my skull that is starting to outsmart ibuprofen.

Ironically, I can’t keep this up much longer. I need to get into the office for a rest.

Like every single game developer on planet Earth I dream of someday developing one of the games I’ve been thinking of for decades now. That may happen in some fashion in the future, but I guess I need to learn to manage my free time just a little bit better first.

Or maybe I just deserved a break – and there are certainly worse ways for a video game developer to pass the time than by playing (**and enjoying!**), you know, video games.

Oh well. I’ll strike the right balance some day, but at least I finally managed to unlock every single achievement in [Batman: Arkham Asylum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Arkham_Asylum).
