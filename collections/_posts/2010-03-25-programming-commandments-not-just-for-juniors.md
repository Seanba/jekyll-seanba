  - Game developer Chad Stewart has compiled a list of commandments for game programmers to follow, with emphasis on the junior programmer. I think he better serves programmers of all expertise.

Fellow game developer [Chad Stewart](http://www.chadpluspl.us/) has written up a list of 10 commandments for junior game programmers to follow:

  1. **Thou Shalt Learn** 
  2. **Thou Shalt Learn Some More** 
  3. **Remember the Code Review to Keep It Holy** 
  4. **Understand Thy Code Base** 
  5. **Honor Knowledge, Keep Reading Books** 
  6. **Thou Shalt Ask for feedback** 
  7. **Thou Shalt Be Wrong** 
  8. **Liketh Nike, Just Do It** 
  9. **Thou Shalt Comment** 
 10. **Thou Shalt Not Break The Build** 

That’s not a bad list at all, although I have to wonder … **what’s with this _junior_ programmer business**? This is the kind of stuff that programmers at all levels should be thinking about no matter what their title is.

And really, is there anything more annoying than a senior-level programmer that gave up learning and reading and improving his craft years ago? The kind of person that thrives on being viewed as the smartest guy in the room, so much so that he won’t ask a question that _just might_ betray him? The kind of person that doesn’t want other people reviewing his work?

**That kind of person drives me absolutely crazy. Have some damn humility.**

Yeah, um, anyway, I recommend [reading Chad’s full post](http://www.chadpluspl.us/?p=105 "Chad Stewart on Game Programming Commandments"). I think it’s telling (and appropriate) that a full five of his commandments (1, 2, 5, 6, 7) are really just about the general act of learning. It’s good stuff.

But that doesn’t mean I don’t have some constructive feedback. 🙂

Chad writes …

> **8. Liketh Nike, Just Do It**

> I read this one in Game Developer. When you have some great idea, don’t let it get lost in the chain of command. Spend a few hours on Saturday and get it done. If it takes multiple weeks, so be it. Spend the time and get it done. That’s step one. Step two? Let everyone know how great you are!

**I recommend strong caution with this**, especially for people new to the business. Enthusiasm and initiative are fantastic qualities but trust me, if you go a bit rogue on the weekend putting something cool you just learned into the codebase then there’s a good chance your fellow programmers will explicitly **not** want to hear about how great you are **once they sync up on Monday morning**.

A long time ago I worked with a guy who, equipped with the first [Game Programming Gems](http://www.gameprogramminggems.com/ "Game Programming Gems books") book, had littered our project with a dozen or so Singleton classes over the weekend – and he was crushed when his work, once discovered, was met with, “_What the fuck is this shit?_” instead of celebration.

If you have a decent lead then he’ll work with you to channel your intensity, and even find a way to put it into a task that excites you. **So find more constructive ways to earn those _atta-boys_.**

Further, Chad says …

> **9. Thou Shalt Comment**
> 
> Get into the habit! It’s a good habit. Comments make life better.

I would first stress that **it is far more important to write code that makes sense on it’s own** and is therefore self-documenting. But failing that, yes, please do comment.

Otherwise, I can’t find much wrong [with those commandments](http://www.chadpluspl.us/?p=105 "Chad Stewart's Game Programming Commandments for Junior Programmers"). If only it wasn’t written for just the junior programmer audience. 😉
