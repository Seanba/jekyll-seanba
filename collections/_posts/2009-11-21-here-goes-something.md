Well, here I am. This blog is something I've been thinking of doing for awhile but just now gathered the momentum needed to get it running.  Great.  Now all I have to do is feed it meaningful content and I’m all set.  I have a new found respect for people who actually make something of this.

My idea for this space is to talk about things that matter to me as a software developer, with a slight bias towards making video games.  In particular I'm looking for ways to optimize the experience **and success rate**.  This gig is a ton of a fun, but I think we humans have a tendency to make it much more difficult than it needs to be.

While making my opinions/rants/musing public I know **I’m probably going to embarrass myself** sometimes, but I went to a tough high school, so I can roll with it. I don't believe I'm especially gifted or anything on this subject ... but I do **care** about my craft a great deal.  Hopefully I'll write a few things on occasion that resonates well with others.

So welcome to my online tree house.  I'll get to writing some real material soon.  In the meantime you can [read more about me here](http://www.seanba.com/about).
