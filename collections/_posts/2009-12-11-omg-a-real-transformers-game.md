While gushing over [Rocksteady's exceptionally executed Batman: Arkham Asylum]({{ '/how-do-you-make-the-best-batman-game-ever/' | relative_url }}.html) one thought kept occurring to me: **I am insanely jealous of Batman fans.** Playing Arkham was a blast for me, but for the hardcore Batman connoisseurs? It must have been pure Nirvana.

[<img class="sba-align-left" title="Optimus - War for Cyberton" alt="Picture of Optimus from War for Cybertron" src="/assets/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/optimuswfc_thumb.jpg" width="186" height="240" />](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/optimuswfc.jpg)

I appreciate Batman as a character - but I'm much more of an [Optimus Prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Transformers)) kind of guy. Unfortunately for us [Transfans](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Transfan) though, the original toy and cartoon dominated our demographic during the video gaming dark ages, after Atari's collapse but before Nintendo became a household name. So to date, we never got a competent effort of our favorite franchise in video game form. 

Yes, yes, I know, Michael Bay's cynical abominations have had video game tie-ins - **but they don't count**.

Anyway, it looks like our wait for the real deal might soon be over. [Activision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision) and [High Moon Studios](http://www.highmoonstudios.com/) are working on a game based on the classic series titled [Transformers: War for Cybertron](http://kotaku.com/5421996/transformers-the-war-for-cybertron-puts-autobots-in-gears).

Judging from the title and concept art it appears the game's fiction takes place millions of years before the Autobots and Decepticons crash-landed on Earth, which suits me just fine. [The War Within](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_The_War_Within) comics took a similar approach and I thought it was the best comic series based on the IP this past decade. I love seeing how the characters looked before taking on their earthly disguises, and [**Cybertron**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybertron) **is just cool** as far as fictional planets go.

Apparently, the developers are borrowing gameplay elements from [Gears of War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_war) and, well, _that’s just prime_. Considering that most battles from the cherished cartoon involve robots taking cover and firing at each other - I think this is a great idea. In fact, since I first played Gears of War I thought it would make a great mechanic for _The Transformers_. It will be very interesting to see how they incorporate transforming and alternate forms into that model though. Perhaps it will be something as ‘easy’ as a minigame, where you play in the other form for a level or two, but I’d love to see it as an integral part of the game*. This is _[The Transformers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Generation_1)_ after all.

**So here's hoping High Moon knocks this one out of the park.** And I pray to Primus they've casted both [Peter Cullen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen) and [Frank Welker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Welker) to voice the iconic characters they breathed life into back in the 80s.

\* Yeah, much easier said than done!
