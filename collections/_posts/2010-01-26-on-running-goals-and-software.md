excerpt: I tried my hand at long distance running and failed. I still learned something along the way, however.

This past November I decided to [run a half-marathon]({{ '/rule-32-enjoy-the-little-things/' | relative_url }}.html) with a friend. I was never really much of a runner (I could barely handle 3 miles on the treadmill) and had previously found that kind of exercise so incredibly boring. But still, it bothered me knowing I could never survive the zombie apocalypse. So I registered, thereby assigning myself a new goal: **In 10 weeks Iâ€™ll be able to run 13.1 miles.** 

Well, the run was held yesterday morning **and I wasnâ€™t there**. 

For the first 7 weeks of training I was feeling great about my progress. I did notice my knees acting up at times (a new sensation for me) but I was right on track to meet my goal. I was going to make it and it was going to be awesome. I was even planning to write about it here and how important it is to challenge yourself and realize your goals and _blah, blah, blah_.

And then 3 weeks ago I foolishly decided to _push through the pain_ (said in my fatherâ€™s voice) while reaching for a new milestone of 8 miles. _Stupid. Stupid. Stupid._ Now one day **after the race** Iâ€™m finally able to run a measly 3 miles again.

Programmers like me are natural cynics so my first thought was to chalk this up as just one more thing in life that I suck at. I tried and I failed. Film at 11.

But on second thought, why am I still running?

Truth be told when I first made the decision to run I figured Iâ€™d just do what it takes to achieve that goal and then move on with my life, all smug and stuff. But something much better happened. **I actually really like running**. A lot.

And now Iâ€™m a bit smarter about it. Iâ€™ve got special shoes to help absorb the impact on my knees and Iâ€™m carefully working my mileage back up. And Iâ€™ll run that bastard of a race next time.

Now maybe I think about my job too much but I canâ€™t help but to take everything I learn in life and somehow apply it to the career I love. When I started my life in game development the goal was simple: **I was going to make a really kickass game.** Metal Gear Solid and Quake 3 and Age of Kings better watch out, I have arrived.

Ten years and three shipped titles later that goal is still not achieved. That does get me down if I allow it - but Iâ€™ve done work Iâ€™m really proud of, with some crazy smart people, and have shipped 3 games that were _just shy_ of being great.

Plus I learned, much more than I thought I would, that **I really do love programming**. Itâ€™s not just about having a career somehow tied to video games anymore.  I get a real kick out of doing my day-to-day job well and learning how to do it better. 

And Iâ€™ll ship that bastard of a triple-A game next time. ðŸ™‚

Itâ€™s kind of like that old saying about the journey and the destination. There is great value to be found in your _attempt_ to meet an important goal, _even if you fail_.
