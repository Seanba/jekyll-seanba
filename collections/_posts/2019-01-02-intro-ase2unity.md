**Happy New Year 2019!** Over the holidays I got back into my hobby projects and put something together that others may find useful.
Yesterday, I made it available for the public under the pay-what-you-want-or-free model.

I love Unity but working with the built-in sprite and animation editors has long been an annoyance for me. 
So, I took what I consider to be the best 2D sprite authoring tool ([Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)) and created a scripted importer for it.

My latest tool, [Aseprite2Unity](aseprite2unity.html), drills into `.ase` or `.aseprite` files and creates sprites and animation clips automatically.
The resulting prefab is ready to go with [SpriteRenderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html) and [Animator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Animator.html) components filled out.

You can download and learn more about this tool [on the Aseprite2Unity page](aseprite2unity.html). **Enjoy!**
