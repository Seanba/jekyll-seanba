This is my little blog where I occassional talk about things I'm interested in (programming, video games, etc.) and share some knowledge I've learned through the years as a game developer.

Most people coming here are interested in the tools I've made available to help with 2D game developement in the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/). [SuperTiled2Unity](supertiled2unity.html)
is what I now use to import [Tiled maps](https://www.mapeditor.org/) into my games and you may find it useful too.

If you'd like to learn more about me and some of the games I've worked on then check out [my about page](about.html). **Thanks!**
