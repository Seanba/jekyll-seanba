This is my little blog where I occassional talk about things I'm interested in (programming, video games, etc.) and share some knowledge I've learned through the years as a game developer.

Most people coming here are interested in the tools I've made available to help with 2D game developement using the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/).

- [Aseprite2Unity](aseprite2unity.html) a Unity pipeline for [Aseprite sprites and animations](https://www.aseprite.org/)
- [SuperTiled2Unity](supertiled2unity.html) a Unity pipeline for [Tiled maps](https://www.mapeditor.org/)


If you'd like to learn more about me and some of the games I've worked on then check out [my about page](about.html). **Thanks!**
